Team: Shu(Alex) Wang, Nan Dong, Weichu Zou, Fanfei Zhao
Housing price is always a popular topic around the world. While beside the most common use of having a place to live and fulfilling basic needs, people also use real estate as a significant investment means. Thus, in this project, we will predict the house price changes in King County (Washington) under different variables, like the number of bedrooms, the square footage, the house view, etc., and present our results as a reference so that people could have an understanding of what factors would most likely lead to the increase or decrease of house prices. We will use Python as the base language to analyze the dataset by creating distribution graphs and correlation tables, running various regression analysis models, etc. Our goal is to find predictive relationships between variables and house prices in King County based on our analysis.
